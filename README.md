# EF Inheritance

Model inheritence (default, TPT, TPC) with Entity Framework demo. 

This is a demo app to show how model inheritence works with Entity Framework. There are 
three ways of how EF manages inheritence. First is `table per hierarchy` which is the default, 
the second is `table per type` and the third is `table per concrete type`.

You can find more details in the [EF documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/inheritance).
